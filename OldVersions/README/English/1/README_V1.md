Google Images is an included feature in the Google search engine that allows image searches. The service has problems. As long as it is connected to Google, it should be avoided, as AMP integration is mandatory, and privacy is illegal here.

Google is attempting to convert all of its images into its [overreaching WebP file format](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Why-you-should-stop-using-Google-WebP/).

It isn't that hard to alternate from.
